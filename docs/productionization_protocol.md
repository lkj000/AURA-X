# The AURA-X Productionization Protocol

This protocol is the definitive guide for deploying the AURA-X ecosystem to a global-scale, professional production environment.

## Core Principles

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire cloud environment is defined in **Terraform**.
2.  **CI/CD for Everything:** **GitHub Actions** are used for automated, zero-downtime deployments.
3.  **Immutable Infrastructure:** All services run as **Docker** containers, managed by an orchestrator (**Kubernetes** or **AWS ECS**).
4.  **Security First:** Architecture includes VPCs, private subnets, a WAF, and a centralized secret management system.

## Phase 1: Cloud Ecosystem Deployment

-   **Action 1.1:** Provision core infrastructure with Terraform.
-   **Action 1.2:** Deploy and migrate a high-availability PostgreSQL cluster (AWS RDS).
-   **Action 1.3:** Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions, AWS ECR, and AWS Secrets Manager.
-   **Action 1.4:** Deploy frontend applications to Vercel.
-   **Action 1.5:** Implement security (WAF) and monitoring (Datadog).

## Phase 2: DAW Client Productionization

-   **Action 2.1:** Establish secure CI/CD build runners for macOS and Windows.
-   **Action 2.2:** Acquire and integrate Apple Developer and Windows EV Code Signing certificates.
-   **Action 2.3:** Integrate auto-update frameworks (Sparkle, WinSparkle).
-   **Action 2.4:** Package final installers (`.dmg`, `.exe`).
